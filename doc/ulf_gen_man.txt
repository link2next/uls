NAME
       ulf_gen v1.6.1, written by Stanley Hong - ulf_gen

SYNOPSIS
       ulf_gen -L <ulc-file> [options] <file|dir>

DESCRIPTION
              ulf_gen generates the frequencies of the keywords of a language.

              ulf_gen  -L  <ulc-file>  <file1> <file2> ...  ulf_gen -L <ulc-file> -o /usr/local/share/a.ulf
              <file1> <file2> ...  ulf_gen -L <ulc-file> -l <list-file> <target-dir>

       -L, --lang=<ulc-spec>
              Specify the lexical-spec(*.ulc) of the language

       -l, --list=<list-file>
              Specify the list of data source files

       -o, --output=<a-file>
              Specify the the output filepath(*.ulf)

       -v, --verbose
              verbose mode

       -V, --version
              Print the version information

       -h, --help
              Display the short help

       ulf_gen collects the usage statistics of given language

              by sampling from source code files.

       It dumps the frequencies of keywords.  After saving them in the file suffixed by  '*.ulf',  you  can
       use  it  together  with  its  ulc-file.   For  example, Let the output file of 'sample.ulc' be 'sam‐
       ple.ulf'.  The file 'sample.ulf' is together read if only it exists in the same  directory  of  sam‐
       ple.ulc.  The ulf-file is optional but can accelerates the generated lexical tokenizer.

       To get the ulf-file of 'sample.ulc' from listed source code files,

              ulf_gen -L sample.ulc a.c b.c src/d.c

       To save the output-file to other file path than default, use o-option.

              ulf_gen -o /opt/share/b.ulf -L sample src/main.c src/main.h

       To process all the file paths in the list file 'a.list'

              ulf_gen -L sample -l a.list /package/home

       This processes all the file paths joined by '/package/home'.
